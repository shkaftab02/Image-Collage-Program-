# Image-Collage-Program-
This program creates a collage by combining four images into a 2x2 grid. The images are resized to the dimensions of the smallest image in the set to ensure they fit neatly into the collage. The final collage is saved in the format specified by the user (JPG, PNG, or TIFF).
